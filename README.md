# Etch-A-Sketch - by Haakon Beck

A web-based recreation of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. This project was developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It allows users to draw interactively on a dynamic grid, with each square changing to a random rainbow color when hovered over.

Live Demo:

## Features

- Interactive grid-based drawing using mouse input
- Rainbow color effect: each square changes color only once when hovered
- Custom grid generator: users can define the size of the grid (from 1x1 to 100x100)
- Reset functionality that clears the canvas and allows size reconfiguration
- Responsive layout: the drawing container adjusts to screen height

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - semantic structure and layout
- **CSS3** - custom styling, animations, shadows, and gradients
- **JavaScript** - dynamic grid generation, event handling, and DOM manipulation
